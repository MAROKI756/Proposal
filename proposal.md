# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Box Run

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
a game where you are a box and you need to avoid obstacles.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
In my game I used Unity and C Sharp because I felt like it would be the best language for me to code it in. I am making just a simple run type of game where the player is a box and there are rectangles in the way trying to kill the box. with a score on the top of the screen. The code will be executed through unity because I feel like unity is very beginner-friendly.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course? 

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
1. NO ERRORS
2. NO BUGS
3. EVERYTHING WORKS SMOOTHLY
4. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
1. ADD MORE FEATURES
2. MORE LEVELS
3. BETTER LOOKING UI

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
1. EVERYTHING WORKS
2. IT MAKES THE PLAYER ACTUALLY WANT TO WIN

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
some new skills that I learned were how to use Unity and how to code with C Sharp. I also started to use blender as well. It started off as using Python but my brother told me that C Sharp would be better for coding this game. So I tried to apply everything that I learned about Python to C Sharp which was harder than I thought. If I had any questions I would just ask my brother.
